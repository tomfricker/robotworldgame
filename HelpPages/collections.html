<h1> Collections </h1>

<p> 
In this level, the concept of collections are introduced. Collections are a convenient way of storing data in programming.
Java uses a range of different collections to store data in different ways. Common collections are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ArrayList</li>
	<li>HashMap</li>
	<li>HashSet</li>
	<li>LinkedList</li>
</ul>
<p>
Collections vary mostly in structure but a user often needs to concern themselves with only a few of their methods. <br>

The two most common features of collections are adding and removing objects to and from them.<br>
the majority of collections will use the add() method like the one featured in the collections level. However HashMaps
use put() instead.<br><br>

The type of object you can put into a collection is determined when it is instantiated in code. <br>
The four collection types listed above have the following declarations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ArrayList&lt;{objectType}></li>
	<li>HashMap&lt;{Key},{objectType}></li>
	<li>HashSet&lt;{objectType}></li>
	<li>LinkedList&lt;{objectType}></li>
</ul>
<p>
The {objectType} part of the declaration is replaced with any type. For example, an ArrayList&lt;Integer> (note the use of 
the wrapper type Integer rather than primitive type int) can only be used to store int values.<br><br>
The HashMap collection is slightly different. It uses a Key which relates to a specific object of the objectType in the 
Map. the type of the key can be different to that of the Objects being stored e.g. &lt;Integer,String> but they may also be
the same e.g. &lt;Integer, Integer>.<br>
There can not be more than one instance of the same key used, however, multiple values may be the same. <br>
i.e. you can have &lt;1,"Hello"> and &lt;2,"Hello"> <br>
but you can not have &lt;1,"Hello"> and &lt;1,"Goodbye">. <br>
<br>
in the latter case, only the second key value pair put into the map will remain at the end.

<h2>Playing the Level</h2>
<p>
The Level has two stages. <br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Stage 1</h3>
<p>
Firstly, three collections of different types will ask you to collect their respective data types which are spread over the board. <br>
You need to talk to the them to be able to collect their objects. and you can only collect for one Collection at a time. <br>
<br>
When you have collected the object for the Collection, you need to return to them to turn your pickups in, in return for points. <br>
<br>
Once you collect all of the Pickups and return them to their collections, you will progress to Stage 2.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Stage 2</h3>
<p>
In stage 2, you will meet a lone collection. You need to use the Code Panel to add char (character) objects to the collection. 
<br>
<br>
The collection's name is chars.
