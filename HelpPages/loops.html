<h1>Loops</h1>
<p>There are three different types of loops that you need to know about.<br>
<br>

<h2>1) for each</h2>
<p>This loop is ONLY used for collections and has the following syntax:</p>
<pre>
for(ElementType element : collection) {<br>
	loop body<br>
}
</pre>
<p>
The for each loop carries out the loop body for each element in the collection.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ElementType element</b> - The ElementType is what class the objects in the collection are, and the element is a reference to an object in the collection. You choose what element is called.</li>
<li><b>collection</b> - a collection of objects of the class ElementType.</li>
<li><b>loop body</b> - statements which will be repeated for each element in the collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is the example from the game: <br>
</p>
<pre>
for(Flower flower : flowers) {<br>
	pickup(flower);<br>
}
</pre>
<p>
First we will look at each part of the loop.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Flower flower</b> - The element flower is an object of teh class Flower. Here I chose the element to be called flower.</li>
<li><b>flowers</b> - a collection of flowers (where each is of the class Flower).</li>
<li><b>pickup(flower);</b> - each flower in the collection flowers will be picked up.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, imagine you have a numbered list of flowers. 
This loop will start with the first flower on your list and pick it up. 
Then it will move on to the second and pick that one up, and so on, until all the flowers on your list have been picked up.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>2) while</h2>
<p>
This loop is used when you want to repeat the loop body an unknown number of times.<br>
It has the following syntax: <br>
<i>Note: boolean means it is either true or false.</i>
</p>
<pre>
while(boolean condition) {<br>
	loop body<br>
}
</pre>
<p>
The while loop carries out the loop body until the boolean condition is false.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>boolean condition</b> - an expression that can be either true or false.</li>
<li><b>loop body</b> - statements which will be repeated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is the example from the game: <br>
</p>
<pre>
int flowerIndex = 0;<br>
while(flowerIndex &lt flowers.size()) {<br>
	pickup(flower);<br>
	flowerIndex ++;<br>
}
</pre>
<p>
First we will look at each part of the loop.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>int flowerIndex = 0;</b> - First we initialise a variable flowerIndex which is an integer and is equal to zero.</li>
<li><b>flowerIndex &lt flowers.size()</b> - the loop will continue while the flowerIndex is less than the number of flowers.</li>
<li><b>pickup(flower);</b> - the flower will be picked up.</li>
<li><b>flowerIndex ++;</b> - this will add one to the flowerIndex.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, once again, imagine you have a numbered list of flowers which starts with zero. 
This loop will start with whatever flower is at the flowerIndex number, it will pick up that flower and then add one to the flowerIndex. 
Then it will move on to the flower at the new number of the flowerIndex and pick that one up, and so on, until flowerIndex is a bigger number than the number of flowers available.
</p>
<br>
<br>


<h2>3) for</h2>
<p>
This loop is used when you want to repeat the loop body an known number of times.<br>
It has the following syntax: <br>
</p>
<pre>
for(initialization; loop condition; increment/decrement) {<br>
	loop body<br>
}
</pre>
<p>
The for loop carries out the loop body until the loop condition is false.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>initialization</b> - is done once at the beginning.</li>
<li><b>loop condition</b> - an expression that can be either true or false.</li>
<li><b>increment/decrement</b> - is done after the loop body.</li>
<li><b>loop body</b> - statements which will be repeated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is the example from the game: <br>
</p>
<pre>
for(int i = 0; i &lt 3; i++) {<br>
	pickup(flower);<br>
}
</pre>
<p>
First we will look at each part of the loop.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>int i = 0;</b> - First we initialise <em>i</em> which is an integer and is equal to zero.</li>
<li><b>i &lt 3;</b> - the loop will continue while i is less than 3.</li>
<li><b>i++</b> - add one to i.</li>
<li><b>pickup(flower);</b> - the flower will be picked up.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, you might have noticed that this loop does exactly the same as the while loop example, but here we know how many flowers we want the loop to repeat for.</p>
<br>

<p><i>(<b>Note:</b> that all of these examples are for demonstrating how a loop works and the loop bodies will not work as written here.)</i></p>
