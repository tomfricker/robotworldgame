<h1>Conditional Statements</h1>
<h2>Stage 1: Relational Operators</h2>
<p> In java there are 6 relational operators which are listed below with their symbol in brackets: These operators are used to compare two values. The signs below except for the equals operator == are used to show inequality between two values. <br><br>
1. <b>	Greater than  (>): </b> This is used to show that the first value is greater than the second value e.g. 5 > 2<br>
<br>
2.<b>	Less than (&lt;):</b> This operator is used to show that the first value is less than the second value e.g 2&lt;5 <br>
<br>
3.<b>	Equals (==):</b> Do not mistake this for the assignment operator (=). This is the only sign that checks for equality and is used usually when two values are the same e.g 2 == 2 <br>
<br>

It does not necessarily have to be used with integer values. They can also be used with other primitive data types like boolean, String , char, double etc. <br>
However in this level we will be looking at how we can apply this operator and the others to boolean values since this is important if you are going to understand how conditional statements work.<br> 
<br>

4.<b>	Not Equal (!=): </b> this sign checks to see if both values are not equal to the other. 7 != 4  since 7 and 4 are not equal to each other this would result in true. If the values did equal to each other then it would result in false. <br>
<br>

5. <b>	Greater than or equal to (>=) :</b> This operator is similar to the greater than operator in that it checks to see if the first value is bigger than the second but in java when it is combined with an equals symbol it also checks if the first value is equal to the second. <br>
<br>
6.	<b>Less than or equal to (&lt;=): </b> Just like the greater than or equal to operator this one is used not only to check if the first value is less than the second but also if it is equal or not. <br>
<br>
Note: The first value can be either less than or equal to, it doesn't have to be both to result in true. This is the same for the greater than or equal to operator.  
</p>
<h2>Stage 2: boolean</h2>
<p>The Boolean primitive data type results in two values:
True or False<br><br>
When using the relational operators that were discussed previously, we can create what is called a boolean expression.<br>
These expressions evaluate to either true or false.<br> You can test these expressions using the operators to see if two variables have the same value.<br><br>
</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String args[]) { <br>
	int x = 10;<br>
	int y = 11;<br>
	boolean test = x > y;<br>
    System.out.println(robot);<br>
 }<br>

</code>
</pre>
<p>The above example will evaluate to false which is also what the System.out.println(robot); statement will print out/display.<br><br> 
This is because the greater than operator is used here to test whether the first value is greater than the second.<br> 
Since 10 is less than 11 the boolean expression will result in false.<br><br>
<b>Note: This command instructs the computer to either, display text, a result of a calculation or a decision. </b><br>
</p>
<h2>Stage 3: Conditional Statements</h2>
<p>Conditional statements help the computer make decisions to do things.<br><br> 
They include a boolean condition which is checked to see if it evaluates to true or false.<br> If it is true, then a certain part of the code will be executed. <br>
The most common conditional statements are called if then statements.<br><br> 

This is an example of how an if then statement is written:</p> <br>
<pre><code><b>If then statement syntax</b> <br>
If (condition) {<br>
	// then do this<br>
}<br>
</code>
</pre> 
<p>Other conditional statements that are used are called If else statements. These offer an alternative decision if the condition evaluates to false. </p> <br><br>


<pre><code><b>If else statement syntax</b><br>
If (condition) {<br>
       // then do this<br>
} else {<br>
      // do this }<br>
  }<br>
}<br>
</code>
</pre>
<p><b>The following code uses a Boolean expression within an if else statement </b></p><br><br>
<pre><code>

public static void main(String []args){<br>
      
	int x = 4;<br>
	int y = 5;<br>
	if(x==y) {<br>
        System.out.println("Hello World"); <br>
	} else { <br>
		System.out.println("Goodbye World");<br>
	}<br>
}<br>
</code></pre>
